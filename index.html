            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>ApostleNet is an amalgamation of personal experiences, scripture, and Bible study plans curated for the hopeless and lost.
                A reminder of the hope, and truth, of the Lord Jesus Christ, and a life truly lived for him.
                It is not an easy life. As a matter of fact, it becomes even harder with time.
            </p>
            <p>But, you become better. You become stronger. 
                I hope and pray that this low point of your journey becomes part of a great testimony, rather than a tumultuous end.
            </p>
                <p>It is an honor, and a privilege to be a part of this journey, in any way possible. You do not have to be alone anymore.</p>
