   <h1>The ApostleNet "Why?"</h1>
   <p>Christian living is the most liberating, yet difficult, lifestyles one could undertake in this life.
    I, for one, have experienced the highest of highs, while experiencing the lowest of lows.
    I have witnessed my quality of life increade in many regards. 
    I have experienced peace I have never felt, joy I have never felt, and a general increase in my quality of living, 
    both physical and mental due to a renewed way of thinking, and discontinued self-destructive habits.
   </p> 

   <p>While I have witnessed the more cliche transformation of my life that many Christiains have gone through,
    I have also witnessed loss, death, my own near-death experience, loneliness, depression, suicidal ideation, 
    and even self harm. The ups and downs of my journey, and I am certain of many others, reminds me of Paul's writings 
    in 2 Corinthians, chapter 4. Stating how:

        <sup>8</sup>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
        <sup>9</sup>Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
        <sup>10</sup>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
        <sup>11</sup>For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
        <sup>12</sup>So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
        <sup>13</sup>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore speak;
        <sup>14</sup>Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

    <p>A Christian life that features both the highs and the lows, the good and the bad, the favorable and downright miserable is not a horror story of an exception, it is a fundamental and unavoidable truth.
        Many Christians, and those outside of the faith, are solely obsessed with the Glory of God, the good to brag about and sing praises of, and they forget that the foundation of the Christian experience is suffering.
        We live in an imperfect, and fallen, world. 
    </p>

    <p>Christ Himself suffered on the cross.</p>

    <p>With my general isolation stemming from living in the middle of nowhere, and my graduation from college,
        there had been moments of isolation and loneliness that became seemingly impossible to bear. 
    </p>

    <p>I had never felt more alone and helpless in my life.</p>

    <p>Having gone through my own mental struggles and suffering, I wanted to create ApostleNet in an effort to make sure nobody ever felt the same hopelessness as I once did.
        To know that even one person was positively impacted by my mission, I would consider the creation of ApostleNet a job well done.

    <p>Know you are not alone. You never were.</p>

    <p>I love each and every one of you,</p>
